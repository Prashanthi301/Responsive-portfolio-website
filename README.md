# Responsive-portfolio-website

The way people use the Internet has changed significantly with the introduction of third-generation cell phones. Nowadays, websites can be read on a variety of devices of different types and sizes. Since the website should be similarly helpful regardless of the type of device used to view it, this place demands on website design. Responsive web design makes it possible to adjust the visual presentation of web pages depending on the device they are accessed with. Although it is a commonly used tool in web development, it has not been fully explored in technical, aesthetic, and practical terms. To this end, standard definitions for this technique were compiled, and a responsive product was implemented in a paper. A fully responsive portfolio website was created

## Why build a portfolio website
A portfolio website is a way to showcase your best work, skills, and expertise to a global audience.A portfolio website is a curated, online space that showcases your best work. It's one of the most practical and memorable ways to share your work with press, potential collaborators or employers. Much like your PDF portfolio, a portfolio website can be used when applying for jobs or internships.
An online portfolio is there for you to display your best work to the world on your terms. You can choose the layout of your portfolio, what pieces to show at the forefront, provide background information on every piece/project, and much more.
f an employer sees your website link in your signature or on your resume, they’ll likely click on it to see what you’ve built. Seeing you’ve taken the time to build a website featuring work samples, recommendations, previous presentations and more will be a killer first impression.
An online portfolio is an excellent reflection of who you are as a person and a professional. You can choose how to present yourself, what works to display, what achievements to list, etc. Again, design and layout are essential here. Unlike social media profiles or an online resume, you can pick the colors, visuals, fonts, interactive elements, and even animations that best reflect your style. You can even show your sense of humor if you wish to do so and make yourself look more approachable.
Going the extra mile and putting effort into your portfolio provides a visual and verbal example of the level of dedication you put into your craft. In other words, an online portfolio makes a striking first impression. It shows you can cleverly communicate a message (the written content on your website) and choose the best ways to display that message (your website’s layout, galleries, work, etc.).
